# Drummerbot in Unreal engine 5.6
A prototype of a drummer bot in unreal engine. Currently very barebone functionality.

Drum models are made by me in blender and imported into unreal as FBX.

### Features
- Pressing ASDF buttons to trigger kick/snare/cymbal/hi-hat
- When the drum is triggered it plays an animation scaling itself up and down as feedback
  - It also plays it's corresponding .wav sound

### Currently working on
A midi feature to be able to import and play midi files
